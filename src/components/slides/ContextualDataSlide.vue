    <h2>Contextual Data Pulling</h2>
    <h3>Level 2: Smart Context</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>When creating a support ticket, automatically pull customer's recent orders, past issues</li>
      <li>For HR forms, auto-populate department, manager, start date from employee records</li>
      <li>Project management tools that pull team member details and availability</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <h3>The Magic Moment</h3>
      <p>User selects customer â†’ System shows: "Last order: Widget X (3 days ago), Previous support tickets: 2 (both resolved), Account status: Premium"</p>
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 2rem;">
      <p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Support agents have full context before the call even starts</p>

// Speaker Notes:
// - This is about providing context, not just filling fields
// - The system becomes predictive about what information is relevant
// - Support ticket example is powerful - everyone understands the pain of lack of context
// - This level requires more sophisticated integration but pays bigger dividends
// - Time: 3 minutes
