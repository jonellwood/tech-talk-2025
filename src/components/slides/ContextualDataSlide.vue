		<h2>Real-World Example 2: Integrated Employee Portal</h2>
		<h3>Your Data Working FOR You</h3>

		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h3>The Challenge</h3>
			<p>
				Employees scattered across multiple systems for basic needs → Repetitive
				data entry everywhere → Information silos
			</p>
		</div>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Employee directory:</strong> Search by almost anything relevant
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Vehicle reservations:</strong> Integrated with fleet management
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Event registration:</strong> From training to flu shots, one
				system
			</li>
			<li><strong>Smart forms:</strong> Work orders, help desk requests</li>
		</ul>

			<h3>The "Better Way" in Action</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>Account requests example:</strong><br />
				Old way: Manual typing, prone to errors<br />
				New way: Select user → position determines permissions → submit<br />
				<strong>Result: From complex form to three clicks</strong>

// Speaker Notes:
// - This shows integration across multiple business functions
// - Emphasize the "one system" approach from the customer perspective
// - The account request example shows dramatic simplification
// - This is about eliminating redundant data entry across the organization
// - Time: 4-5 minutes (part of 7-minute myBerkeley section)
