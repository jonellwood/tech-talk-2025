			</li>
			<li>
				Every form they fill out, every process they navigate - that's their

			<li>
				They don't care about your departmental boundaries or system limitations

			<li>They just want to get their job done with minimum hassle</li>

// Speaker Notes:
// - Ask audience: "How many of you have filled out the same information on multiple forms?"
// - This is about empathy and customer-focused thinking
// - Internal customers (employees) count just as much as external
// - The customer doesn't see your org chart - they see one experience
// - Set up the examples that follow with this mindset
// - Time: 3 minutes total
