// Speaker Notes:
// - Start with relatable question - everyone has experienced this
// - Mention the stats come from docuclipper.com (they have vested interest but stats are directionally correct)
// - Emphasize that the data already exists in their systems
// - Set up the premise that we're not talking about new data collection, but better use of existing data
// - Time: 3 minutes total
