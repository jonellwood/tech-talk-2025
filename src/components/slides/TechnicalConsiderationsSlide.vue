      <li><strong>Data quality first:</strong> Clean your source data before connecting it</li>
      <li><strong>Caching strategies:</strong> Balance real-time accuracy with performance</li>
      <li><strong>Fallback options:</strong> Always allow manual override</li>
      <li><strong>Security and permissions:</strong> Ensure users only see data they should access</li>

// Speaker Notes:
// - Technical considerations but keep it practical
// - Data quality is foundational - garbage in, garbage out
// - Caching prevents API calls from slowing down forms
// - Fallback is crucial - system should gracefully degrade
// - Security often overlooked but critical for adoption
// - Time: 2 minutes
