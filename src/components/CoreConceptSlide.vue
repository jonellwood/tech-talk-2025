		<h2>Making Systems Talk to Each Other</h2>
		<p>Core Concept: Data Source Integration</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>API-first thinking:</strong> Connect your CRM, Financial
				Applications, HR systems, customer databases
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Real-time lookups:</strong> Auto-populate forms using existing
				customer/employee data
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Smart defaults:</strong> Use historical data to pre-fill common
				selections
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Validation at the source:</strong> Check against existing data
				to prevent duplicates and errors
			</li>
		</ul>

		<div class="highlight-box">
			<h3>The Key Principle</h3>
			<p>Single source of truth, multiple points of access</p>

// Speaker Notes:
// - This is the foundation - systems talking to each other
// - API-first: emphasize that most modern systems have APIs, even if not well documented
// - Real-time: balance between performance and freshness of data
// - Smart defaults: learn from user behavior and patterns
// - Validation: catch errors before they propagate
// - Time: 5 minutes total
</script>
